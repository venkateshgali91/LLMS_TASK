 Then he went straight to his father, and found him sitting in his verandah with his five sons round him; and the lad bowed his head. 'Give me the news from the garden,' said the sultan. And the youth answered, 'The dates have all been eaten by some bird: there is not one left.'Beth smoothed her wiry half-black, half-gray hair from her makeup-free face. In New Mexico, the natural look was common. Standing next to Cindy Fanucci, she felt like a disaster. She hid her ragged nails under the sleeves of her sweatshirt. “Hi, I’m Cindy. It’s so nice to meet you, Beth
"I'm not done here." "But-" "And I'm not your f**king meal," he added, a touch of heat whipping through his words. So he had heard that part. Cassie had thought his enhanced hearing would pick it up. The redhead glared at Dante, then at Cassie
He had the ridiculous desire to chase after her, but even as the thought skated tantalizingly through his mind, reality intruded. "You know, I'm beginning to think there's something going on between you two." Cheyenne stood behind Hardy, arms crossed over her chest, chin set at an argumentative angle. Hardy sighed, turning to walk away from her. "There is nothing going on between us, Cheyenne
He was about to let out a burst of laughter when the wagon came to a screeching halt. All the humor left him at once. Other than the low idle of the engine, everything became dead quiet. Strange mechanical noises crept from the back of the wagon like the sound of gears waking within a clock tower. Then he heard similar noises from the front of the wagon
"My serum Creatinine is high, although everything else within my kidney profile is apparently normal, according to the hospital. So is my potassium, but that could be an artifact, so they say. It apparently comes from eating too many bananas." "Do you eat bananas?" "I can think of a whole lot of things to do with bananas
Cooper groaned, and his body sagged back. "You weren't supposed to be first," Deuce snarled as he lifted the gun and took aim at Cooper's prone form. "But if that's the way you want it, old buddy..." "No!" Gabrielle threw her body forward and wrapped her arms around Cooper
Talking about it normally bothered me, but with him, I felt I could say anything. "Everyone said I shouldn't have survived," I explained. "Because of where I sat and the way the car hit the tree. Lissa was really the only one in a secure spot. She and I walked away with only a few scratches
 know we don’t really need a song.” “True,” Jenna said, “but I want one. I think we deserve one after all this, don’t you? And anyway, it’s supposed to make the wood burn longer.” “But why do I have to sing
He shook his head, took a step back and held his hands up as he tried to smile without losing a cigarette. “Yes you can,” Julia said in a reassuring voice. “I’ve already focused on my friend. You just have to click the shutter, on top, here.” He nodded sheepishly, through his cigarette away and took the camera

Even as he settled back into the cushions of the swing, though, he heard a soft voice: "Mateo." Nadia looked so beautiful. She wore a soft white dress that outlined every inch of her, and her black hair gleamed in the moonlight. But nothing was as incredible as her eyes as she drank him in. Mateo felt like he could hardly speak. Yet he managed to whisper, "Nadia
Lamla touched his shoulder again. ‘Come away, Kandrigi. You will blind yourself.’ Kandrigi remained glued to the tube. Lamla called Ma-Tin, who took his time about looking around – he was gazing down on the Ka, his assistants on either side of him. He spoke to one, and he reluctantly left his post and came across and helped Lamla pull Kandrigi away from the tube
"Of the two of them, who has the strongest appeal?" he asked. "Leanne," I said. "Not that I don't like Winter," I added quickly, remembering they were cousins. "What's the name of the third woman again?" "Macy Roth." I had no connection with her at all, no way of casually running into her as I had with Leanne
My wife refused to allow me to come to Hong Kong when the plague was at its height and–” “Your wife, Johanne? You are married at last?” Johanne grinned. “Well, when a man gets to my age, he starts to need a few home comforts. After my dear mother passed away ten years ago now, I became lonely
And I could ignore the feeling of being owned ... it was a loose ball and chain and I was heady with the power, the attention, the money. Until I met Camille." He took a deep breath, still not daring to look at Regan. "I knew that Alcroft, who was known as Mr. Tradd in those days, was interested in Camille
There was no cover if someone was guarding the beach. All remained quiet except for the sound of the breakers and smell of decaying seaweed. No words were spoken as one of the SEALS opened the sled and Peter began stripping out of his dive gear and into civilian clothes. Just as quickly, the SEALS stowed his gear back in the sled
All at once she understood why this whole day she'd felt even more consumed by Daniel than usual, and also even more conflicted about Cam. She'd dreamed about them both last night. She'd been wandering through a dusty fog, someone holding her hand. She'd turned, thinking it would be Daniel
he yelled, throwing the barrel onto the bench top as Frobisher continued to shake her head furiously, her eyes wide with horror. Peterson released the gag and, as Frobisher coughed and spluttered, he undid her wrists and legs. “Wally!” screamed Frobisher. “Wipe your hand on that towel! Now! Before it soaks into your wounds.” Peterson frowned at her and picked up the towel
“Aye.” “And what are you looking at?” “Molly. She’s a bee but she’s dead.” “Well, that is very sad. May I look as well?” “Aye.” Shelly extended the glass to her. To Miss Currivard’s great credit, she too sank to her knees, took the glass and examined the bee
He does not ask for money or even any help, and his uncle does not offer. Brian wasn't expecting him to. He knows this is something he has to go through alone to prove something to himself. And to his uncle. His uncle nods. There's a glimmer of respect in his eyes. Respect Brian doesn't often see. "Good luck in clearing your name, Brian
"I realize it's probably not a good idea to have this conversation over the phone." "We'll talk later," she said, but Chase was afraid that might be too late. "I didn't want this misunderstanding to ruin what we have." "And what do we have, Chase
After a few seconds, I see my mother come into my view, falling to her knees beside the person just sitting up. It's my father. I squeeze my eyes shut over my tears when I see him wrap one arm around her shoulders and lean into her. But then an even more painful realization slices through me. Jake went back in. To get Shane. He's risking his life for a man like Shane
she asked him. "They will not let me continue matching the nibbler pups with their parents. They say it is too dangerous. That all of the nibblers must be brought to the palace now," said Hazard. "They will be safer here," said Luxa. "Yes, now that the diggers can be heard tunneling toward the arena," said Hazard
Her brother would probably rip my eyeballs out and shove them down my throat if he knew. Something told me he wouldn't find out. That she wouldn't tell anyone. Not that she could keep a secret. She was so free with words, always saying what was on her mind, whether it was appropriate or not. I especially loved it when it wasn't appropriate
It didn't stop me from wishing I could be as impervious to it as my companions, though. Vampires and ghouls might not like the cold, but I was the only one whose teeth were chattering. "All right, luv?" Bones asked it while not taking his gaze off the trees in front of him. We were dead center in front of the house, and hopefully that wasn't prophetic
Dad's trashed your room, but they haven't found any drugs yet. And they didn't find any in your locker, and I'm guessing they didn't find any in the car, or I would've heard about it. So right now, it's all okay." "I'm telling you, there aren't any drugs
Ella moved in front of him and, after a quick glance up the road, sprinted through the gate and onto the lawn, avoiding the gravel pathway and heading towards the house. They ran under the windows along the side of the building until they came to the back porch. Ella chanced a look around the corner at the kitchen door. The door is open, I don't hear anything though. Oisin answered instantly. Either do I, we must move, they're close
“Ah, it’s called reading. Ever try it?” Amber snickered. On Thursday afternoon, Amber got a call from Peggy. “Hey Amber. I’m about ten minutes away. Do you guys want to meet me in the parking lot?” Darren and Amber didn’t have a car so they had made plans to ride with Peggy
Gran said a short blessing and everyone dug in. I couldn't help but notice the apprising looks she was giving Cole and I. Was Gran trying to set me up with Cole? No. She couldn't be. She loved Sam, and I knew it. I saw it in her aura. Yet, there was love in her aura too every time she looked at Cole
My focus wasn't as ironclad as I'd always believed. Let's just say I'm going to need another Guinness the instant I step foot on U.S. soil again. Poor Henry. The days where his infectious smile and shrug could fix just about any problem were over ... and what was I doing thinking Poor Henry? If that wasn't the last time I put those two words together, I would wrap a rubber band around my wrist and snap it each time I even thought about pairing Henry's name with the word poor
She held it away from him. “Don’t be an idiot,” she said. Rackenfauz cocked the rifle with authority. “Okay Colonel,” he said, “we’re out of here – now!” Reyes fixed the old professor with a steely glower. “You’ll never get away with this, Rackenfauz
It’s nothing more than a faceless, formless brown blob to me but I take his word of the resemblance to our genetic makeup. The vial’s emerald contents are carefully tipped into the dish. A second later, the combined liquids have become a mass that is both liquid and gaseous and rapidly expanding. I see it creeping slowly, a writhing cloud of teal the size of a person now
She thanked Matt, hung up the phone and decided to cook. That would sooth her nerves. Derek was fine. He could take care of himself, she continued to tell herself. He would call her. Amber gathered supplies and ingredients and began making lasagna from scratch. After an hour she forgot about the note that sent her tearing home and lost herself in the cooking
on one of the beds, her back to Diane. She closed her eyes against the pain inside her and She WAS WALKING along the Left Bank with Mark, chatting about everything and nothing. Kelly felt that she had never been so completely comfortable with anyone before. She said to Mark, "Tomorrow evening there's a gallery opening if you're interested in-" "Oh, I'm sorry, Kelly
